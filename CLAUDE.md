# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to agents when working with code in this
repository. See `README.md` for setup instructions and available commands.

## Workflow Rules

- **Documentation**:
  - Keep `docs/*.md` design documents in sync with behavioral changes.
  - Update `docs/file-index.md` when adding, renaming, or removing source files.
- **Commit Preparation**:
  - Ensure `README.md` is updated if setup or debugging commands change.
  - Include all significant changes in the commit message.

## Development Conventions

### Code Logic
- **Documentation**: Where code has subtle or surprising logic, add comments to explain the "why" and intended behavior.

## Planning vs Implementation
When the user asks you to implement something, start coding quickly. Do NOT
spend the entire session planning unless explicitly asked for a plan. If a plan
is needed, keep it concise (bullet points, not paragraphs) and confirm with the
user before elaborating further. Default to action over planning.

## Git & Commits
- When committing, include ALL relevant changed files — check `git status` before committing to avoid missing files like TODO.md, documentation, or new files.
- Always update the file index when adding or renaming files.

## Code Changes
- Use the file index to help find relevant files.
- When changing behavior, read existing design docs to understand previous designs and intentions. Ask questions if unsure if we should change those requirements.
- When the user asks for a change, apply it consistently to ALL similar patterns.
- Do NOT drop or overwrite existing content in files like README.md — preserve what's there and add to it.
- When similar logic occurs on multiple parallel paths, use common helper methods when possible, to ensure the logic stays consistent.
