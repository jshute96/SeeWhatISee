# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to agents when working with code in this
repository. See `README.md` for setup instructions and available commands.

## Workflow Rules

- **Documentation**:
  - Keep `docs/*.md` design documents in sync with behavioral changes.
  - Update `docs/file-index.md` when adding, renaming, or removing source files, or when their description should change. The index is a navigation aid meant to describe what the files are now.
  - **`docs/file-index.md` is a one-line-per-file index, NOT a place for design summaries.** Each row gets a single short sentence (≈ 80–120 chars). If you find yourself wanting to explain *how* a file works, that belongs in `architecture.md` or other docs, not the index.
  - **No prose blobs in design docs.** Hard rule: any block of text longer than ~4 lines must be broken up into bullets, sub-sections, or smaller paragraphs. Reviewers should be able to scan the page without reading any single chunk top-to-bottom.
    - If a single concept needs multiple sentences, split it across bullets.
    - If a doc section grows past ~8 lines, give it sub-headings.
    - Prefer bullets to paragraphs; prefer short bullets to long bullets.
  - When adding a new feature, you can add new sections in the relevant design doc rather than appending to an existing one.
- **Commit Preparation**:
  - Ensure `README.md` is updated if setup, commands, or user-visible features change.
  - Include all significant changes in the commit message.

## Development Conventions

### Code Logic
- **Documentation**: Where code has subtle or surprising logic, add comments to explain the "why" and intended behavior.

## Planning vs Implementation
When the user asks you to implement something, start coding quickly. Do NOT
spend the entire session planning unless explicitly asked for a plan. If a plan
is needed, keep it concise (bullet points, not paragraphs) and confirm with the
user before elaborating further. Default to action over planning.

## Git & Commits
- When committing, include ALL relevant changed files — check `git status` before committing to avoid missing files like TODO.md, documentation, or new files.
- Always update `docs/file-index.md` when the file set changes or file descriptions become stale.

## Code Changes
- Use the file index to help find relevant files.
- When changing behavior, read existing design docs to understand previous designs and intentions. Ask questions if unsure if we should change those requirements.
- When the user asks for a change, apply it consistently to ALL similar patterns.
- Do NOT drop or overwrite existing content in files like README.md — preserve what's there and add to it.
- When similar logic occurs on multiple parallel paths, use common helper methods when possible, to ensure the logic stays consistent.

## Keep the skill/command files in sync

These skill and command files describe the same `log.json` outputs and the
same steps to take for each. Keep the instructions consistent across these
files, including formatting, so diffs only show intentional differences.
