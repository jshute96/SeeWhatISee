// adds ~1s of launch overhead and a visible window flash. Tests get
// their own page via `extensionContext.newPage()` inside each test
// body and clean up after themselves.

// `serviceWorker` is *test-scoped* (and depends on the worker-scoped
// context) because the MV3 service worker can idle out and respawn
// between tests, which invalidates any previously-captured Worker
// handle. Re-resolving per test gives each test a live handle.
//

  //     without extra per-extension preference plumbing.
  //   - data: URLs aren't matched by the manifest's <all_urls> host
  //     permission, so the capture isn't authorized.
